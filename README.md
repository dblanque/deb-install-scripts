# Debian Install Scripts

Just a mini-repo with some useful installation scripts for:
* Bitwarden

`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dblanque/deb-install-scripts/refs/heads/main/update_bitwarden.sh | bash`

* Discord

`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dblanque/deb-install-scripts/refs/heads/main/update_discord.sh | bash`

* Zen Browser (it really just uses the official one checking you're not root)

`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dblanque/deb-install-scripts/refs/heads/main/update_zen.sh | bash`

Hope it's useful for you.

Regards,
Dylan
